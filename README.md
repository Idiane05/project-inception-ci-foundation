# Project Inception, Planning & CI Foundation

This repository contains the implementation of a structured development workflow for a Node.js project as part of a professional DevOps assignment. It demonstrates proper planning, secure branching, and CI pipeline setup.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project includes:

- A functional "Hello World" Node.js application
- ESLint integration for code linting
- Jest for basic unit testing
- GitHub Actions for automated CI (runs on pull requests)
- A secure GitHub workflow with branch protection on `main`

> 🔐 **All changes and development were done in the `develop` branch** to ensure safe code practices. Pull requests from `develop` to `main` are protected by:
> - Required code reviews
> - CI checks (linting + tests)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Node.js
- JavaScript
- ESLint
- Jest
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Projects (for task tracking)
